##Description
Flat-planner is a web-based app for magazine planning. It allows every staff member at a magazine to view one central flatplan, containing information about the pages in the magazine. 

Every user account includes an organization account of the same name, which can be used for personal projects, tests, etc. Users can be added to all organizations, and their permission level can be set to either 'view' or 'edit.' Separate organizations can be created for different magazines, and then individual flatplans can be created for each issue of the magazine. Pages can be color coded, and marked with slugs for the stories they're set to contain. Users can also add pages and delete pages as the project changes. At the page level, users in the organization can be assigned to work on certain stories, design elements, etc.

I'm hoping to eventually use this app for my own magazine, Nieman Reports, published here at Harvard. There are some minor features that I wasn't able to implement in the allotted time, such as creating separate object for individual stories in the magazine and exporting to PDF. In the future, I would also like to add the ability to create flatplans for things other than magazine, like websites, newspapers, books.

##Details for teaching team

There will be an example flatplan with a number of pages and assignments made already. You can also view my account and some details added for Nieman Reports.
